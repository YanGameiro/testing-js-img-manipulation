Just testing JavaScript Image Manipulation using jimp


The code is crap by now, but I'm just making sure that this "jimp" has the features that I need:

- Create a image canvas; 
- Draw a border; 
- get 2 images together; 
- Place text boxes; 

RUN
----------
Just download the repo, enter the folder, and run `node run.js`
